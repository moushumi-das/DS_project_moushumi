# Bird Image Classifier
For this Data Science project I have used deep learning for image classification.

## Overview 
For this project I built a bird classsifier to itentify singing bird from different part of the world. This could be useful for someone who is interested to know about singing birds. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could provide the some information about those singing birds.This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the type of bird with 93% accuracy after minimal tuning. In most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.

## Config
I have used google colab for this project as it makes the gpu configuration far easier.

## Data
I have used the following chrome extention to download the data from google images. [Fatkun Batch Download Image](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/nnjjahlikiabnchcpehcpkdeckfgnohf?hl=en)
